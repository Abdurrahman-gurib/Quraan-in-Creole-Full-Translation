      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        The **Quraan in Creole** project was founded with a singular goal: to make the teachings of the Quraan accessible to the Creole-speaking community in Mauritius and beyond. We believe that understanding the sacred text in one’s native language is essential to deepening one’s connection with the divine and living a more meaningful life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our mission is to preserve the authenticity of the Quraan while providing an accurate and culturally relevant translation that resonates with the Creole-speaking audience. We are committed to ensuring that the message of peace, love, and guidance from the Quraan reaches those who may otherwise face language barriers.
      </p>

    <section class="history">
      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        The idea for translating the Quraan into Mauritian Creole was born out of a need to bridge the gap between the spiritual teachings of Islam and the Creole-speaking population of Mauritius. Many in the community, despite their strong faith, faced challenges in fully understanding the Arabic text of the Quraan due to the language barrier.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the years, the project grew from an initial translation of key verses to an ongoing effort to translate the entire Quraan. With the help of linguists, scholars, and dedicated volunteers, we are now in the process of completing the translation, with a focus on clarity, cultural context, and spiritual accuracy.
